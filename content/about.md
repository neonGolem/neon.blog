I'm an electronics engineer with high functioning ADHD and probably some form of autism. This is my project porfolio, not really sure how far I'm willing to take it, but right now I feel like I want an outlet like this and I bought the .com so ehh, fuck it. 

The blog is made in hugo and hosted by cloudflare, the template/theme is Terminal and I've left much of the references to the original author in place to give credit.
