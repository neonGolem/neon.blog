Theres a stillness in the air. The weather can best be described as sticky. The sun, belting down on me relentlessly. Silence. It feels like time itself has stopped. A faint sound of crows in the distance.  
There it is. Finally found it. I’ve felt this before. I've been after this for a long time.  
The year is 1996 and I’m about to enter first grade. Except I’m 36, the year is 2025 and it is a Sunday. Both of these are true. Both of these _feel_ true. It’s as if I’ve stepped through the fold, crossed the veil, to a bygone era. It feels like a lifetime ago. I can feel the weight of these years, all of it, at once.  
I stare down an empty parking lot, watching the heat haze wave about in the air. I’m basking in this sensation, I'm absorbing it. It is a strange feeling of nostalgia. One that isn’t tied to a specific memory, but to the _texture of existence itself_. I’ve been here before. I’ve felt this in the past. The commie blocks. The cracks in the pavement. The trees to the side, stretching their roots into the concrete, bulging, cracking, forcing their way through.  
The stillness. The crushing stillness that somehow inspires comfort. It invokes emptiness yet familiarity. It makes you feel like you’re alone in the world, yet it feels cozy. Like watching hand drawn anime on a VHS tape.  
A temporal shift. Two realities colliding, bleeding into one another, meshing and fusing into one.  It is the emptiness of the moment that gives it this liminal feeling. On the boundary of time itself, neither here nor there. This feeling, this rift in time and space, it holds endless potential. A seedling.  
Could I do it?  
A car rolls into the parking lot. The spell is broken. I solidify in reality once more. Damn. This time was close. Too close. So close I could almost touch it. I was almost there.  
Why though? What am I chasing? A second chance maybe? A means to redo everything? All of it?  
I chuckle. I already know the answer. I know exactly how this would pan out. I would painstakingly gouge my deepest memories. I would follow the traces. I would execute the plan to the letter. All of it, exactly the same. All of it, so that I could make the exact same choices. Smoke the exact brand of cigarettes, drink the same beer and take the exact same taxi to the exact same, wrong address. Lose my keys at that very day, crash my bike on the same intersection. I would repeat everything, do it all the same to a tee, all in the hopes of meeting you again, one more time. It was magical. All of it. A second chance? A life lived without regret does not ask for a second chance.

  Hey look, AI art. I think this is okay though, no? Using it for something like this - a writing exercise that I quite frankly don't ever see myself making public. This time it kind of nailed it in one go though. I didn't specify the outfit on the guy, but hey I think it works.
