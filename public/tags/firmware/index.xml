      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;am-i-still-an-engineer&#34;&gt;Am I still an engineer?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question itself is pretty wild coming from me, someone working as an engineer, but hear me out. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I wrote any firmware or did any work on any microcontroller in general. This is then an excellent smoke test - do I still have what it takes? The premise is not too outlandish. Wire up an STUSB4500, tell it to negotiate 5V3A, 9V1.5A  and 15V3A. A month ago, I placed an order with a Chinese manufacturer and received the boards last week. By default the IC does not negotiate 9V - which is incidentally the one I need, because that&amp;rsquo;s what the cheapest big capacity powerbank I chose to use does. For programming the device, I left a 100mil grid of testpoints that I intend to connect to using pogo pins. The 3x2 grid consists of 2 vias in opposing corners, a ground, a power and the I2C pins. Simple enough. An afternoon is all it should take.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The firmware for the power supply is going to be fairly complex in the sense that I have a lot of features on the board. The main issue is the user addressable IO and ADC pin. A custom interpreter is the way to go here, but I have no good idea on how to even approach this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;   (07.08.2025) &lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/posts/smoke-test/&#34;&gt;The smoke test.
